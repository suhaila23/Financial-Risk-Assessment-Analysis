# Financial-Risk-Assessment-Analysis
A cross-platform analytics project using Python, R, and Tableau to study financial risk patterns in loan applicants and present insights through an interactive dashboard.


 Objectives

* Identify the key factors influencing loan applicants’ financial risk.  
* Analyze relationships between demographic, employment, and financial variables.  
* Validate patterns using statistical hypothesis testing.  
* Visualize insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard for decision-makers.  
* Support responsible and strategic lending through data-driven recommendations

Tools & Technologies

* Python– Data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)  
* R Programming – Statistical hypothesis testing (t.test, aov, chisq.test, Z-test, F-test)  
* Tableau – Interactive dashboards & KPI visualization
